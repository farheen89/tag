Gruppo Modulo Rewrite Sample
-------------------------------
Thank you for downloading our Rewrite Sample!

Installation, configuration, etc.
---------------------------------
Basic installation is as simple as extracting all the files 

>>>> EXCEPT rewrite.sql <<<<< 

and uploading to a directory on your web server. 

Then you need to edit connect.inc.php with your settings.

Finally you just have to create the database. You can use the included file rewrite.sql
or create your db manually. If you create the db manually, remember to edit 
the names of tables and columns in the queries.
